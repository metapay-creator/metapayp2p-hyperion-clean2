# metapayp2p-hyperion-clean on Metis Hyperion Testnet — Web3 Basic Income Simulation with AI & Peer Transfers

*(Powered by OpenAI API & Alith AI)*

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

metapayp2p-hyperion-clean is a Web3-based simulation of a circulating basic income system designed by Gyuha Yoon.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate a sustainable economic model where income is continuously circulated rather than endlessly printed.

- ✅ National Wallet distributes funds equally to 10 citizen wallets over 10 distribution rounds.  
- ✅ After every 10 distributions, 10% of citizen balances are recollected.  
- ✅ This Distribute → Recollect → Repeat cycle ensures sustainability.  
- ✅ Citizens are free to engage in peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers anytime, simulating a real economic ecosystem.  
- ✅ Alith AI monitors economic activity and warns of imbalances or risks.  
- ✅ OpenAI API powers AI-generated behavior logic and intelligent alerts.

## 💹 MetaPay Circulation Model Overview

![MetaPay Circulation Chart](./public/metapay_full_flow_chart.png)

- 🟩 Monthly distribution (green)  
- 🟥 Recollection every 10 rounds (red)  
- 🔵 Cumulative circulating balance (blue line)  

> This graph demonstrates how the balance grows with 10 cycles of distribution and stabilizes through periodic recollection, enabling a sustainable circulation model of basic income.

**Important:**  
In the MetaPay simulation, the national wallet must follow a strict cycle of **10 rounds of distribution followed by 1 round of recollection**, repeated continuously.  

If after 10 distributions and 1 recollection the **National Wallet balance remains at 4999**, the system requires **manual adjustment** by transferring **1 unit** from a **user wallet holding an odd amount of MetaPay** back to the National Wallet.  

This allows the next distribution to proceed normally.

> In real-life pilot projects, population increase or decrease may require manual adjustment accounts or automated balancing bots to stabilize the circulation system.

---

## 🏛️ Real-World Pilot Project Consideration

MetaPay’s model suggests implementing either:

- ✅ **Manual Adjustment Accounts** for population fluctuations  
- ✅ **Automated Balancing Bots** integrated with on-chain monitoring tools  

This allows seamless adaptation even in dynamic economic environments.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- ✅ Phase 1: Simulation & AI Behavior Analysis (Completed)
- 🔄 Phase 2: Automated Balancing Mechanism (Planned)
- 🏛️ Phase 3: Institutional Pilot Testing with Governments/NGOs (Planned)
